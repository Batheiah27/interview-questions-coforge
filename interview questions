You are a DevOps Engineer responsible for deploying and maintaining
a cloud-native web application.
 
Application Architecture:
- Backend API (containerized)
- Frontend (containerized)
- PostgreSQL database
- Deployed on cloud using Terraform
- Running on Kubernetes
 
Tasks:
 
1️⃣ Scripting (Core DevOps Skill)
- Write pseudocode or outline a script (Python or Bash) that:
  - Builds a Docker image 
  - Tags it with a version and latest 
  - Pushes it to a container registry 
- How would you handle:
  - Failures 
  - Logging
  - Secure credential handling
 
2️⃣ Terraform – Cloud Automation
- Design a Terraform structure to:  
  - Provision a Kubernetes cluster
  - Create networking (VPC/VNet, subnets)
  - Deploy a database service
- Explain:
  - Remote state management
  - State locking
  - Module structure best practices




3️⃣ Docker
- Explain how you would:
  - Optimize a Dockerfile for production 
  - Reduce image size 
  - Avoid security vulnerabilities
- What is the difference between:
  - CMD vs ENTRYPOINT 
  - COPY vs ADD 
- How do you scan images for vulnerabilities?

FROM ubuntu 
RUN apt update
RUN apt install git -y
 
4️⃣ Kubernetes
- How would you deploy the backend API to Kubernetes?
- Explain:
  - Deployment vs StatefulSet
  - Service types 
  - ConfigMaps vs Secrets 
- How do you handle:
  - Rolling updates 
  - Auto-scaling 
  - Pod failures
 
 
You do NOT need to write production-ready code.
Focus on explaining your thinking and real-world experience.
